    This gives a list of all of the files that are on your project. Because this works with external services, some
    ours and some not, there is some extra data that you need for how to interact with those services.

    At the top level file list of your project you have a list of providers that are connected to this project. If you
    want to add more, you will need to do that in the Open Science Framework front end for now. For everything in the
    data.links dictionary, you'll have two types of fields: `self` and `related`. These are the same as everywhere else:
    self links are what you use to manipulate the object itself with GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT requests, while
    related links give you further data about that resource.

    So if you GET a self link for a file, it will return the file itself for downloading. If you GET a related link for
    a file, you'll get the metadata about the file. GETting a related link for a folder will get you the listing of
    what's in that folder. GETting a folder's self link won't work, because there's nothing to get.

    Which brings us to the other useful thing about the links here: there's a field called `self-methods`. This field
    will tell you what the valid methods are for the self links given the kind of thing they are (file vs folder) and
    given your permissions on the object.

    NOTE: Most of the API will be stable as far as how the links work because the things they are accessing are fairly
    stable and predictable, so if you felt the need, you could construct them in the normal REST way and they should
    be fine.
    The 'self' links from the NodeFilesList may have to change from time to time, so you are highly encouraged to use
    the links as we provide them before you use them, and not to reverse engineer the structure of the links as they
    are at any given time.
