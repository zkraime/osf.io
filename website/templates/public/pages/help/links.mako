<h4>Links</h4>
<p>Links are an alternative to building a component within a project. Adding a link means that
    instead of making a new component or project inside the project, the component already exists separately and
    is only being pointed to from the present project.</p>
<p>Any existing public project can be a link, be it your own project or someone else's. Linking is useful if
    you want to reference another person's work or indicate that something is part of a larger
    project.</p>
<p>A link can be created by visiting the project you want to add the link to. Click "Add Links" in the components
    section of your project dashboard and search for the project you wish to link to.</p>
