            <h1>OSF for Meetings</h1>

            <p>
                The OSF can host posters and talks for scholarly meetings.
                Submitting a presentation is easyâ€”just send an email to the conference
                address, and we'll create an OSF project for you. You'll get a permanent
                link to your presentation, plus analytics about who has viewed and
                downloaded your work.
            </p>

            <p>
                OSF for Meetings is a product that we offer to

                for a conference, email us at
